**MechLang** is an open-source, text-based language for representing organic chemistry reactions and curved-arrow mechanisms semantically.

It encodes chemical meaning symbolically rather than visually, enabling structured reasoning over reaction mechanisms.

Technologies:
- JavaScript
- Custom symbolic encoding system

Focus:
- Formal representation of chemical transformations
- Computational reasoning over reaction logic
- Language design for domain-specific modeling
