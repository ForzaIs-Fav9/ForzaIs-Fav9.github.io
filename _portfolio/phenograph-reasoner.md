PhenoGraph Reasoner is a graph-based reasoning assistant designed to analyze multimodal symptom data and explore potential neurological or genetic patterns.

This project was developed using LLM-assisted workflows (Gemini) to accelerate architecture prototyping and reasoning system design.

My contributions focused on:
- Designing the problem structure
- Defining the graph reasoning logic
- Structuring symptom-to-condition inference
- Iterating on reasoning pipelines
- Refining AI outputs into consistent logical flows

Technologies:
- TypeScript
- Knowledge graph modeling
- LLM-assisted system design
