I am a Grade 12 student focused on high-performance learning, competitive mathematics, and JEE Advanced preparation.

My current work centers around:

- Structured problem-solving systems
- Competitive exam mastery (JEE & Olympiad level)
- Programming in Python and C++
- AI and computational thinking
- Physical performance and discipline systems

I am actively building projects that integrate optimization, systems thinking, and performance modeling into real academic preparation.

This site documents my work, progress, and technical projects.
